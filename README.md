# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview
The SellBy stakeholders want an analysis on Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. One of the fifty databases is to be chosen and find if there is any positivity bias for the reviews in the Vine program.

1. Pick a database and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to the AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.
2. Use PySpark to find out if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members.
